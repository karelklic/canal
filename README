Canal
=====

Canal is a static analysis tool designed to analyze behaviour of
application programs written in C. It is based on the theoretical
framework of abstract interpretation, with focus on the scalability to
large programs and proper handling of real-world source code.

Canal comes with a versatile command line tool that can step through
the analysis of a program like a debugger can step through the
execution of a program, and investigate values of variables and other
parts of the analysis.

Canal is divided into three basic components, each with specific
responsibility:

- Abstract domains. They embed the semantic choices, data structures,
  algorithmic aspects, and implementation decisions of analysis. Canal
  includes abstract domains representing machine integers, floating
  point numbers, arrays, pointers, and structures.

- Interpreter. It iterates through the source code until the analysis
  is finished. It manages the state of program analysis consisting of
  abstract values.

- Operations. They manage the translation of program instructions to
  abstract operations defined as a part of abstract
  domains. Interpreter uses operations to update abstract values
  stored in the analysis state.

LLVM framework is used as the technological foundation of the
analysis, and CLang is used to compile C programs to the LLVM
intermediate representation.  Canal works with LLVM 2.8 to 3.2 and any
recent Linux distributions (Fedora 16+, RHEL 6+, Ubuntu, Gentoo).
